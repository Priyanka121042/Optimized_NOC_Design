Design of Optimized_Network_On_a_Chip:

Given the problem of limited speed due to increased latency in the case of the architecture at hand, we aim to find ways of better context switching and arbitration rates which help us achieve better performance in terms of speedup. We can adjust the weights of thr round robin arbitrator making use if genetic algorithms. We can formulate the equation for speedup using different factors such as message retrieval timings in case of throttled and non-throttled state inputs, static timing analysis parameters such as setup time and hold time and other important parameters that could be responsible for introducing delay into the system. The logic for prefetchers can also be similarly arrived at using particle swarm optimization algorithm, to simulate an impartial and fair prefetching mechanism.
