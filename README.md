This repository is aimed at proposing a solution to speed and power optimzation of a Network on a Chip. We will try to integrate reinforcement learning along with few aspects of Genetic Algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization concepts to arrive at an optimal design for the "Network on a Chip" Architecture.
